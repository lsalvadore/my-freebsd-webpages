<p>I am a FreeBSD developer, more precisely I am a ports committer, but I often work on docs too.</p>

<p>If you want, you can take a look at my <a href=https://github.com/lsalvadore>GitHub profile</a>.</p>

<p>I am also a hacker for fun: you can see my profiles on <a href=https://tryhackme.com/p/salvadore>TryHackMe</a> and <a href=https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/855831>HackTheBox</a>.</p>
